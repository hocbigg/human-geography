# Summary

The Human Geography curriculum is a **complete education in Human Geography** using online materials.

## Organization

This repository is organized into 2 main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;

**Process:** Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

These four sections form the essential backbone of Human Geography. Complete them in this order before moving on to anything else:

1. **Foundations of Human Geography**  
   Start here. This section introduces the basic ways geographers think about the world.

2. **Geographic Research Methods & Spatial Evidence**  
   Next, learn how geographers ask questions and gather evidence. This is the toolkit you will use throughout the rest of the curriculum.

3. **Core Human Geography Domains**  
   This is the heart of the discipline. Study these major subfields in any order you prefer, but finish all of them before proceeding to specialization tracks.

4. **Regional & Systems Geography**  
   Finish the core by learning how geographers understand the world as interconnected regions and systems.
