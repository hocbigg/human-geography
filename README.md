## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

These four sections form the essential backbone of Human Geography. Complete them in this order before moving on to anything else:

1. **I. Foundations of Human Geography**  
   Start here. This section introduces the basic ways geographers think about the world.

2. **II. Geographic Research Methods & Spatial Evidence**  
   Next, learn how geographers ask questions and gather evidence. This is the toolkit you will use throughout the rest of the curriculum.

3. **III. Core Human Geography Domains**  
   This is the heart of the discipline. Study these major subfields in any order you prefer, but finish all of them before proceeding to specialization tracks.

4. **IV. Regional & Systems Geography**  
   Finish the core by learning how geographers understand the world as interconnected regions and systems.


### Specialization Tracks

The remaining sections (V, VI, and VII) are **optional specialization tracks**. They build directly on the core and allow you to explore particular interests or future directions.

- **V. Development, Globalization & Planning**  
  Focuses on economic change, inequality between places, and how societies shape cities and regions.

- **VI. Social Difference, Health & Mobility**  
  Centers on people’s lived experiences, identity, well-being, and movement through space.

- **VII. Power, Environment & Global Challenges**  
  Examines power relations, environmental crises, and the big global issues of our time.
